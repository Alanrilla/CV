                <p><i>Supersor at AT&T & Self Learnt Web Developer</i></p>
            
                <p>I have been working for customer care at AT&T for about 6 years now. I have been enjoying the work even since I started. 
                    I have developed myself and I have practised multiple times to progress and become a manager but without luck. After time AT&T has decided to put several employees on down roll
                    and multiple employees started leaving the job. As now I am seeking for a job which will not only be a job to myself in order to live a life on a decent level but I also want to do 
                    something which I will enjoy doing it. I want to be part of something bigger which has the purpose moving forwards and to look for day after day.
